# Technical Challenges

1. Version Matrix Compatibility
   - Python/Airflow/Provider version combinations
   - Breaking changes between versions
   - Maintaining backward compatibility in generated code
   - Version-specific features and deprecations

2. Code Analysis Complexity
   - Dynamic imports and runtime dependencies
   - Custom operator inheritance chains
   - Macro template resolution
   - XCom usage patterns across tasks
   - Task group nesting and dependencies

3. Environment Dependencies
   - Connection configurations across different platforms
   - Environment variable handling
   - Secret backend integrations
   - Custom plugins and hooks

4. Performance Implications
   - DAG file parse time
   - Task scheduling overhead
   - Memory footprint with large task groups
   - Database access patterns
   - Task queue optimization

5. Testing Challenges
   - Mocking external services
   - Connection simulation
   - Task context reproduction
   - Schedule interval validation
   - Trigger rule verification

6. Code Generation Constraints
   - Maintaining existing code style
   - Preserving custom comments/docstrings
   - Handling custom decorators
   - Task ID collision prevention
   - Import organization

7. LLM Integration
   - Context window limitations
   - Provider-specific knowledge
   - Code style consistency
   - Error handling patterns
   - Security considerations
